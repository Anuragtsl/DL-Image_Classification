# DL-Image_Classification

I have created a [Convolutional Neural Network]() for Classifying.

I have created an GUI format for using the model.

I have used [Jupyter notebook]() for coding!

Follow the **[notebook]()** for more!

# Image Classification Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

Airplane
Car
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
